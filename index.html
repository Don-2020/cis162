        <p>My name is Donirvin Dickerson, a computer science major at CSULB. Despite taking this class, this will not be my first introduction into web development. I took a summer bootcamp many years ago that taught me both back-end and front-end coding. I'm taking this course as a refresher and a grade booster. Aside my work and study in computer programming, I am a huge history buff, and constantly researching the history of many different cultures, locations and stories.</p>

            <li>Spend quality time with people I like</li>
            <li>Attempt to workout or just play video games.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> because its a one stop shop for me to watch others explain, showcase, play or talk about some of my favorite things. </p>
